deraied states => state thats computed from an existing peice of state or from props 
three seprate peice of state even through num items a nd total price depend on cart 
1.yha teen ki jarurat ni h ku ki ye dono cart ki state pr depend kr rhi h  so we do not need num items state an dtotal price 
2. need to keep them in sync (update togather)
3. 3 states update will cause 3 renders
// so we can derive the state from the cart and use it in to seprate 
1, we can use regular variables , no use state
2. cart state is the single source of truth for this related data
3. works because re rendering component will automaticlly re calculate derived state
/////////////////////////////////////////////
practical like stats we need a length of the items so we mention it in the new variable and pass as prop => so what happen here is whenever the items state updates the app will we render and again call the fxn and get the num items get update
